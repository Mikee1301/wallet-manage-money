## Description

Wallet manage money that allows users to manage their income, expenses, and budgets. The app supports setting budget goals, categorizing expenses (e.g., must, wants, needs), and associating them with specific categories (e.g., groceries, allowances). It also supports tracking accounts, where income increases the balance, and expenses decrease it.
